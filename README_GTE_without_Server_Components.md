GTE_WSC: GTE without Server components
--------------------------------------

To run GTE without server components means just to use the drawing functionality. 
The drawing functionality is entirely coded in Flex and therefore needs only access
to the SWF file.

1. Specify the output directory of the GTE_WSC version in build.properties using the GTE_WSC variable
2. Build GTE_WSC using the ANT target: makeWithoutServer
3. Go to the output directory specified in (1) and extract the Zip file
4. Open index.html with your web-browser
5. If you don't see the GTE IDE you have to add the output directory to your trusted sites in the global flash settings.
   You can edit your settings using this link:

6. Open index.html with your web-browser again
